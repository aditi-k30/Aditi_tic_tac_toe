# Aditi_tic_tac_toe
A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can take turns with 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game detects wins, draws, and allows for restart. The design is visually appealing, with smooth transitions and a footer crediting the creator "Made by Aditi."
